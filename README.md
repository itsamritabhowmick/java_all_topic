# 📚 Java Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my **Java Learning Repository**!  
This repo contains my practice code, concepts, and small projects as I learn **Java** step-by-step.  
I'm currently pursuing an MSc in Computer Science, and this journey is part of building a strong foundation in object-oriented programming.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- ✅ Basic Syntax & Hello World
- ✅ Variables & Data Types
- ✅ Input/Output using Scanner
- ✅ Operators & Expressions
- ✅ Control Statements (`if`, `switch`, loops)
- ✅ Arrays
- ✅ Methods (Functions)
- ✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - Classes and Objects
  - Inheritance
  - Method Overriding
  - Abstraction using `abstract` classes
  - Polymorphism
- ✅ Java Collections (like `ArrayList`)
- ✅ String Handling
- ✅ Practice Examples
